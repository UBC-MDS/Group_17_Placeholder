# DSCI 532 Group 17 Project Teamwork Contract 

## Team members:
Jordan Casoli, Nick Lisheng Mao, Hatef Rahmani, Steven Lio

## Expectations
The time expected for group members to work on DSCI 532 will be a maximum of 6 hours unless all the team members agree to lengthen the time expected. If team members cannot complete their sections within the maximum hours, members should give notice on Slack at least 24 hours before the group submission date (Saturday 6 pm) to see if work should be redistributed or if the expected time should be increased.
All submissions are expected to meet the criteria of the milestones as set out in the instructions. This includes making sure all scripts are working, data wrangling is correct, and using proper grammar in written submissions.

## Meetings
- Regular meeting: Monday: 2 - 4 pm during the regular lab session
- Touchbase meeting: According to milestone progress, team touch base session scheduled at 6 pm on Thursday

All members are expected to attend the meetings. If a member cannot make a meeting, written notice must be given 24 hours before the meeting to discuss alternative options.

## Communication
All communication outside of the meetings will be through Slack or Github. Github will be the primary communication tool for ideas, suggestions, submitting work and reviewing work. Slack will be the primary communication tool for informal communication and scheduling meetings.
Roles
There are roles team members will be responsible for each week. The roles are as follows:
- Responsible for taking notes at the meetings and in-class lab sessions and adding as a GitHub issue.
- Responsible for sharing all notes and in-class activities with teammates.
- Responsible for doing a final check of the submission before the deadline to make sure all requirements are satisfied.
- Each member will be responsible for the submission for each week (i.e. Create Release, validate final version, submission) in the following order
  - Milestone 1: Hatef Rahmani
  - Milestone 2: Lisheng Mao
  - Milestone 3: Jordan Casoli
  - Milestone 4: Steven Lio
- Responsible for individual parts.
 
## Deadlines & Reviews
Deadlines for individual items will be assigned during meetings. All members are expected to submit a pull request for their work on the repository for the group project on Github.com. Members are expected to add teammates as reviewers to have all pull requests reviewed by another teammate. Pull requests should be reviewed within 24 hours after creation.
All team members are responsible to review the work before the Milestone deadline and ensure that the final version is ready for submission.

## Breach of Contract
Failure to follow the team contract will result in a three-step warning system:
The first step is a written Slack notice that outlines the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the team contract conditions.
The second step is a meeting to discuss the behavior and write an agreement to follow the team contract that is required by the member.
The third step is to reach out to the lab instructor or TAs of the issues with the teammate
