# 2. Description of the data (Hatef)
This dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. You are also encouraged to analyze data from the ongoing 2016 survey found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-2016).

# 3. Research questions you are exploring (Lisheng)

Our application aims to provide data insights for new graduating students who seek jobs in tech companies. They hope to make informed decisions based on factors related to mental health illness or attitudes towards mental health in workplace. They may want to [explore] the data to have a basic understanding of data, [compare] the effect of variables to a specific survey response question based on a selected filter and [make inference] based on geographical locations and other explanatory variables.   
When they log onto our application, they can find three tabs: summary overview, interactive view and map view. The summary overview provides a basic understanding of explanatory variables versus response. They can select a specific survey response question and add explanatory variables on the left panel and the results will be shown on the right panel.  
The interactive view provides a more detailed filter and enables user to select a subset of explanatory variables. For example, a user may find that the response variable "percentage of hearing or observing negative consequence for coworkers with mental health conditions in your workplace" is different for company of size under 5, 6-25, 26-100 so on and so forth. Based on this observation, our user can make a hypothesis that the size of a company is positively correlated the probability of observing negative consequence.   
In the map view tab, our users can choose response question and explanatory variables as they have done in the interactive view. Taking the response question mentioned above, users may read from the map that the response is mapped to countries or states and a deeper color indicates a higher percentage of observing negative consequence for coworkers with mental health conditions in your workplace. Using the map view, users may easily make inference based on geographical variable. For example, one may hypothesize that companies located on west coast have higher probability of observing negative consequence compared with middle US or east coast.
