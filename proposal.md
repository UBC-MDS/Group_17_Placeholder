# 1. Motivation and purpose (Jordan)

Our role: Data scientist consultancy firm

Target audience: Both tech employers and employees

Even today, both employers and employees are more likely to acknowledge physical health conditions than mental health conditions. While some employers are ahead of the curve in terms of acknowledging the importance of employee mental health, there are many workplaces where employees still do not get the support that they need. For employers, this can lead to high employee turnover as well as lower quality work. For employees, this can lead to further deteriorating mental health. To address these challenges, we propose building a web dashboard that visually illustrates the current state of mental health in tech. Our app will allow employers to explore how different variables relate to the mental health of employees, as well as give employees insight into how their workplace compares to other workplaces in various aspects of mental health.
